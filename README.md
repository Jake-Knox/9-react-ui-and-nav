# React UI and Navigation

- Looking to be sure up my understanding of making UIs and Navigation with React. 
- No real objective apart from spending dev time getting better.

# extra info
- using sass/scss (because I like it)
- limiting functionality (this is about trying to make something that looks nice)
- I will keep links to other website inspo (probably bbc sites) either here or in components
